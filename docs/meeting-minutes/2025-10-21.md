## Agenda
- Review recent research and publications (2021–present)  
- Identify frequently cited papers and key datasets  
- Analyze algorithm evaluation methods and comparison baselines  
- Categorize research by algorithm type (GA, MOEA)  
- Discuss integration of AI tools and thesis methodology

## Discussion Summary

| Topic | Key Points | Decisions / Notes |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| Research progress | Focus on finding and reviewing recent (post-2021) papers from Google Scholar. | Prioritize the first page of results (2021–2023), then the second page for the most recent two years. |
| Challenges | Need to identify which datasets and evaluation methods are commonly used. | Compare how algorithms are benchmarked and what metrics are used. |
| Next steps | Organize findings by algorithm category (Genetic Algorithms, Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms). | Also document how AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) were used in the research and writing process. |

**Checklist**

- [x] Define scope of literature search (Google Scholar, 2021–present)  
- [ ] Review first and second pages of results  
- [ ] Note frequently cited papers and data sources

## Additional Notes
- Focus on how researchers structure individuals and define operators.  
- Pay attention to datasets used for comparison and evaluation metrics.  
- Include in thesis that AI tools (such as ChatGPT) were used for organization and summarization support.
